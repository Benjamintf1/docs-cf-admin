This topic describes how operators can effectively plan the organizations and spaces to make the best use of the authorization features in Cloud Foundry

## <a name='whatfor'></a> What are Organizations and Spaces For?

Organizations are a way of grouping related people that share a set of interests and needs.

Things scoped to an Organization:

* Control over space quotas
* Available private domains
* Access controls for roles:
	* Manager – view and assign quotas, roles; create and manage spaces, quotas
	* Auditor – view org quotas, roles
	* Billing manager – view org quotas, roles, utilization metrics

Spaces are a way of grouping related things that share a particular context.

Things scoped to Space:

* Service instances
* Routes
* Quotas on:
    * usage of paid services
    * number of app instances
    * number of service keys
    * number of routes
    * number of reserved route ports
    * memory used across the space
    * memory used by a single app instance
* Access controls for space resources

## <a name="opinion"></a>Is the Platform Opinionated?

While the platform leaves it to you to map an “organization” or “space” in a way that works for you, it does provide some hints.  If you view the [handful of roles](../concepts/roles.html) defined within Cloud Foundry, you can see the principle of least privilege at work.  Each of these roles exists for a purpose, and features within the platform are built to enable these purposes.

As a rule of thumb, if your mapping of foundations, organizations, and spaces makes one or more roles less useful, then you’re likely working at odds with many other features and assumptions within the platform.

## <a name="mappingfoundations"></a>Mapping Your Company’s Structure: Foundations

![Company and environments roughly map to Foundations](mapping_foundations.png)

Foundations:

- Take a lot of work to maintain
- Define the outermost boundary for shared components such as domains, service tiles, and physical infrastructure.
- Generally, the human cost of maintaining a foundation means it maps to your prod/non-prod environments.

A note about environments: environments like sandbox, non-prod, and prod are almost always their own foundation.

More specific environments like dev, UAT, QA, or perf are often mapped at the org or space level with a suffix (ie. space-dev)

![Company-wide environments built for a specific testing stage usually are contained in their own Foundations](mapping_foundations2.png)

Forces to Consider

- How many foundations can your platform team maintain (create, update, and monitor)?
- How much isolation does your organization require?
- Do you need foundations local to a particular cloud or IaaS environment?

The impact of mapping larger subsets of your company to foundations:

- Less Maintenance
- Less isolation
- Better use of shared platform components

The impact of mapping smaller subsets of your company to foundations:

- More maintenance (could be offset with platform automation)
- Higher likelihood of foundations being different
- More isolation

## <a name="mappingorgs"></a>Mapping Your Company’s Structure: Organizations

![Organizations can encompass Business Units, environments, teams, or products](mapping_organizations.png)

Organizations:

- Group a set of related people
- Provide the outer boundary for self-service, enabled by organizations roles.
- A logical construct with no upper limit
- Companies should aim for the highest granularity that maximizes the people interested in the same stuff being in the same organization and minimized the opposite - often a business unit or product team.

![Organizations most often map to a business unit in a particular foundation](mapping_organizations.png)

Forces to Consider

- How will you plan for capacity needs/changes?
- What groups need to self-organize together?
- How will you measure cost and perform billing/chargeback?


The impact of mapping larger subsets of your company to organizations:

- Less quota micromanagement
- Ability to delegate user onboarding
- More likely there are people with divergent needs
- BU must be platform trained and manage potentially many spaces

The impact of mapping smaller subsets of your company to organizations:

- More quota management from platform team
- More freedom to create spaces as needed

## <a name="mappingspaces"></a>Mapping Your Company’s Structure: Spaces

![Spaces can encompass Teams, Products and specific deployables](mapping_spaces.png)

Spaces:

- Group a related things that need to share a context
- Define a fence-line inside which apps can share deployment details such as routes and service bindings
- Are cheap to create and tear down, providing on-demand isolation for experiments & testing
- Provide no finer access roles, so all users with access to the space have access to everything within it.  Use this to define the “who” for a space.
- Companies should map this to the lowest granularity that minimizes the likelihood someone will change something that doesn’t belong to them

![Spaces most often map to one product of the several products a team may work on, which may include several deployed artifacts in a microservice architecture](mapping_spaces2.png)

Forces to Consider

- When should a new space be created or destroyed?
- What developer processes require the sandboxed isolation?
- Are teams building single apps or constellations of microservices?
- Are teams building a portfolio of apps or standalone apps?
- Do all apps need public routes?
- What apps need to share the same service instance?

The impact of mapping larger subsets of your company to spaces:

- More likelihood of accidental changes to someone else’s app/service
- Easier integration between apps
- More apps can use non-public routes


The impact of mapping smaller subsets of your company to spaces:

- More app isolation
- Security with more specific ASGs
- More reliant on external services or service instance sharing
