title: Managing Custom Buildpacks
owner: Buildpacks
---

This topic describes how an admin can manage additional buildpacks in <%= vars.product_runtime %>
(<%= vars.product_short %>) using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI). If your app uses a language
or framework that the <%= vars.product_short %> system buildpacks do not support, you can take one of the following actions:

* Write your own buildpack. For more information, see [Creating Custom Buildpacks](../buildpacks/custom.html).

* Customize an existing buildpack.

* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-docs-contrib/wiki/Buildpacks).

* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks).

## <a id="add"></a> Add a Buildpack

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must be a <%= vars.product_short %> admin user to run the commands discussed
in this section.</p>

To add a buildpack:

1. Run:

    ```
    cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK PATH POSITION [--enable|--disable]
    ```
    Where:
    * `BUILDPACK` specifies the buildpack name.
    * `PATH` specifies the location of the buildpack. `PATH` can point to a ZIP file, the URL of a ZIP file, or a local
      directory.
    * `POSITION` specifies where to place the buildpack in the detection priority list.
    * `--enable` or `--disable` specifies whether to allow apps to be pushed with the buildpack. This argument is
      optional, and defaults to enable. When a buildpack is disabled, app developers cannot push apps using that
      buildpack.
