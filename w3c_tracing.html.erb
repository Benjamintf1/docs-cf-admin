You can use W3C tracing to troubleshoot failures or latency issues in your apps. You can trace requests and responses
across distributed systems. For more information, see [w3c.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/).

For more information about how the Gorouter works with HTTP headers and W3C tracing, see the [HTTP headers for W3C tracing](../concepts/http-routing.html#w3c-headers) section of the _HTTP Routing_ topic.

To trace app requests and responses in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>, apps must also log W3C headers.

After adding W3C HTTP headers to app logs, developers can use `cf logs myapp` to correlate the trace and span IDs logged by the Gorouter with the trace IDs logged by their app. To correlate trace IDs for a request through multiple apps, each app must forward appropriate values for the headers with requests to other apps.
