## <a id="overview"></a> Overview 

<%= vars.product_short %> includes an optional, beta routing plane that uses a service mesh. A service mesh provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices. For more information, see [What is a service mesh?](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/#what-is-a-service-mesh) in the Istio documentation. 

Service mesh in <%= vars.product_short %> uses Istio Pilot and Envoy. The Cloud Foundry `istio-release` packages these components into a BOSH release. For more information, see the following:

* The [Pilot](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/#pilot) section in Istio documentation. 
* The [What is Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/what_is_envoy) topic in the Envoy documentation. 
* The [istio-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/istio-release) repository in GitHub. 

Service mesh deploys an additional router and runs as a parallel routing plane as illustrated in the following diagram:

![A load balancer receives requests at *.YOUR-APPS-DOMAIN and forwards them to the Gorouter. The Gorouter then forwards them to an app. A separate load balancer receives requests at *.mesh.YOUR-APPS-DOMAIN and forwards them to the istio-router. The istio-router then forwards them to an app](service-mesh.png)

## <a id="features"></a> Features

Service mesh currently supports configuring routing weights for app. For more information, see [Using Weighted Routing (Beta)](../devguide/weighted-routing.html).

## <a id="limitations"></a> Limitations

Consider the following when deploying service mesh:

* It does not have feature parity with the existing routing plane in <%= vars.product_short %>. 
* It is for deployments with fewer than 20,000 routes. At greater scale, it may impact core platform functions. 
* The control plane is not HA and registration of new routes may be delayed during upgrade. 
* The domain for routes is `*.mesh.YOUR-APPS-DOMAIN` and is not configurable. 

## <a id="components"></a> Component VMs

The following table describes each component VM deployed as part of service mesh in <%= vars.product_short %>, along with their function.
