To enable this configuration, you must perform the following steps:

1. Add your certificates to your load balancer and configure the listening port. The procedures vary depending on your IaaS.
1. Configure your load balancer to append the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers to client requests.
    * If the load balancer cannot be configured to provide the `X-Forwarded-For` header, the Gorouter appends it in requests that are
    forwarded to applications and system components, and sets the IP address of the load balancer.

    You must configure the load balancer to forward the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. Otherwise requests to some
    applications and system components result in redirect loops, as requests determined to be unencrypted are
    redirected to HTTPS.
