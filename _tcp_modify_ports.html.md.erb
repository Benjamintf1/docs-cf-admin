(Optional) Configure the `routing_api.router_groups` manifest property with the same range of ports that you configured your load balancer with in a previous step.
    <pre>
    routing&#95;api.router&#95;groups:
    &minus; name: default-tcp
      reservable_ports: 1024-1123
      type: tcp
    </pre>
  For more information, see the [Routing Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release) repository in GitHub. To modify the ports after you have deployed, see [Modify TCP Port Reservations](#modify-ports) below.
