To enable this configuration, use the following steps:

1. Add your certificates to your load balancer and configure the listening port. The procedures vary depending on your IaaS.
1. Configure your load balancer to append the `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers to client requests.

    <br/>If the load balancer cannot be configured to provide the `X-Forwarded-For` header, the
    Gorouter appends it in requests that are forwarded to applications and system components, and sets the IP address of the load balancer.

    <p>If the load balancer accepts unencrypted requests, it <strong>must</strong> provide the X-Forwarded-Proto header. Conversely, if the
    load balancer cannot be configured to send the X-Forwarded-Proto header, it cannot not accept unencrypted requests.
    Otherwise, applications and platform system components that depend on the X-Forwarded-Proto header to
    reject unencrypted client requests and accept unencrypted requests.</p>

1. Insert the certificates into your deployment manifest for the Gorouter:
    1. Open your release manifest with a text editor.
    1. Copy the contents of your certificate chain and private key that is associated with your certificate into the `properties.router.tls_pem` field.
    1. Set `enable_ssl` to `true`.

        ```
        properties:
          router:
            tls_pem:
            - cert_chain: |
                -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
                SSL_CERTIFICATE_SIGNED_BY_PRIVATE_KEY
                -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              private_key: |
                -----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
                RSA_PRIVATE_KEY
                -----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            enable_ssl: true
        ```
