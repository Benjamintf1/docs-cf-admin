You can use Zipkin tracing to troubleshoot failures or latency issues in your apps. You can trace requests and responses
across distributed systems. For more information, see [Zipkin.io](http://zipkin.io/).

For more information about how the Gorouter works with HTTP headers and Zipkin tracing, see the [HTTP Headers](../concepts/http-routing.html#http-headers) section of the _HTTP Routing_ topic.

To trace app requests and responses in <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>, apps must also log Zipkin headers.

After adding Zipkin HTTP headers to app logs, developers can use `cf logs myapp` to correlate the trace and span IDs logged by the Gorouter with the trace IDs logged by their app. To correlate trace IDs for a request through multiple apps, each app must forward appropriate values for the headers with requests to other apps.
